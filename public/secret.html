  <ul>
    <li>To keep your cut flowers fresh for longer, add a teaspoon of sugar and a few drops of bleach to the water in the vase. The sugar nourishes the flowers, while the bleach helps prevent bacterial growth.</li>
    <li>If you want to fall asleep faster, try the 4-7-8 breathing technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly for 8 seconds. This can help calm your mind and prepare you for sleep.</li>
    <li>When cooking pasta, add a splash of olive oil to the boiling water to prevent the noodles from sticking together. This simple trick can make a big difference in the texture of your dish.</li>
    <li>To remove stubborn stickers or labels from surfaces, use a mixture of equal parts vinegar and baking soda. Apply it to the sticker, let it sit for a few minutes, and then peel it off easily.</li>
    <li>If you're ever in a tough spot and need to remember someone's name, try repeating it back to them during the conversation. This not only helps reinforce the name in your memory but also shows that you're engaged in the discussion.</li>
    <li>To make your phone battery last longer, turn on battery saver mode and reduce the screen brightness. Additionally, closing unused apps running in the background can help conserve power.</li>
</ul>
